### El Hadji Saliou Niass

## A small Python project 
for this project, the goal is to develop a Python application that reads the above picture (available as a .png file) in low resolution, to generate a scalable version (generated as a .svg file) that can be used as a high-resolution wallpaper for any computer. The application should, therefore, read an input file (file.png)   and produce an output file (file.svg) that one can open and render with any compatible application (e.g., inkscape on Linux).
